# `elba/index`

This is the repository for [elba](https://github.com/elba/elba)'s default package index. It's totally hosted on Github and maintained by [@elba-bot](https://github.com/elba-bot),
which means that even if @elba-bot fails and is offline, the packages will still exist
and the index will continue to work.

If you'd like to upload a package, see [The Package Control Panel](https://github.com/elba/index/issues/2), and if you want to learn more about package indices, see [Documentation](https://elba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/indices.html).
